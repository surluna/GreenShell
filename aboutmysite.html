    <p>Building this website has been a very educational experience in my web design course, in terms of both what I
      learned technologically and the insights gained.<br><br> One of the important insights that comes through loud and
      clear is that detailed planning at the very beginning is needed. Although I had made some initial sketches of how
      I want
      to place my website components, in retrospect, if I had created a comprehensive wireframe and one that was
      detailed, something similar to what a product manager creates, I could have saved a lot of time and effort during
      the latter stages. When the detail in the wireframe is maximum, it is like a clear route map and the number of
      alterations and changes reduces to the minimum.
      <br><br>
      Another huge takeaway is the need for a deeper understanding of responsive design.Even though I tried to set all
      the values in percentages as much as possible in an effort to create a layout that would fit at any size, my site
      didn't behave perfectly when tested on different devices. This has made me realize the need for an in-depth
      comprehension of the principles and
      techniques of responsive design. Increased knowledge of media queries, flexible grid systems, and responsive
      images would strongly have improved user experience across devices.
      <br><br>
      So I also learned the value of modular design. For instance, the repetitive element, such as a navigation bar or
      fixed buttons, could be much more effectively developed using component-based methodologies. While I do appreciate
      that template engines in the back end, such as EJS, can decrease the hassle in such cases, I learned that there
      are front-end methodologies to approach this too, such as developing it using JavaScript frameworks or Web
      Components. What I do now with these elements is just to copy and paste them across different pages, which is sure
      to yield redundant and non-maintainable code. Doing something in a modular fashion would not make the codebase so
      clean and elegant, but it would add up to be easily maintainable and updatable.<br><br>
      From the lessons I had in class, I have established that to be basically successful in the field of web
      development, there is a need for continuous
      learning and adaptation. Had I known earlier, I would have approached the project differently, especially in terms
      of planning, responsive design, and the modularity of the content. This project has obviously taught me quite a
      few technical skills and improved my problem-solving readiness for all kinds of challenges on the internet.
