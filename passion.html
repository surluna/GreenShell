    <p>Hi, I am Ziwei. I have a strong interest in web development and have previously created a few small scale
      so-called
      "toy projects". However, I've always aspired to gain a deeper understanding of web design and to develop a real
      industrial-grade project. I hope that through this course and the construction of this project, I can not only
      enhance my technical skills but also positively influence my future career path in web development.<br><br>

      I enjoy online shopping in my daily life and have had an internship experience at an e-commerce platform, giving
      me some insight into the workings of e-commerce. At the same time, I am deeply concerned about our planet's
      environment. I always try my best to protect the environment and use eco-friendly products. I've noticed a lack of
      mainstream shopping sites focusing on eco-friendly products, which inspired me to create this project.<br><br>

      This platform is more than just a shopping site, it's a place to realize our vision. Our goal is to provide a
      convenient and reliable shopping option for consumers who wish to protect the earth. Here you can easily find a
      variety of eco-friendly products, saving time in selection while fulfilling our shared eco-friendly vision,
      contributing to the ecological harmony of our planet.<br><br>

      My website slogan is:
    <p class="green">Go Green, Live Clean.</p>
    </p>
